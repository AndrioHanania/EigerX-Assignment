The requested method and his test method is
inside 'DepartmentWithEmp' class.
To run the test you need to:

1. make sure the you have postgres on your computer

2. you have already created DB called 'eigerxdb'.
   Or  just change the prop on the application.properties file.

3. The intellij need to be connected to your DB.

4. if you dont have any data in your DB you can run
   the application from the 'EigerXAssignmentApplication' class
   (i have created configuration class that put data in the DB,
   for the specific test).
   BEFORE YOU CAN RUN THE APPLICATION:
   you need to put the right data inside the application.properties file,
   like:
   username and password for your postgres user (i deleted mine for security purpose),
   the name of the DB,
   unused port for the application.

5. FINALLY: you can run the test.
