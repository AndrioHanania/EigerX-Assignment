# EigerX-Assignment
I completed the four exercises successfully (including the bonus exercise).
Each part has its own test.
Very important: for each part you have to read its readme file, to understand how to run and check the exercise.

I really enjoyed the exercises and learned a lot in a short period of time.

Hope to talk to you soon.
